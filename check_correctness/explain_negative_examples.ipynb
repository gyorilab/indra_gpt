The sentence discusses the interaction between Ang-1 stimulation and p85beta with Tie-2, while the statement discusses the activation of PIK3R2 by TM7SF2. There is no direct connection or mention of TM7SF2 or PIK3R2 in the sentence.                                                                                                                                     \n1  No, the statement \"EIF4G binds EIF4E2\" is not implied by the sentence. The sentence only states that TNRC6A interacts with eIF4E2, and that eIF4E2 can bind to the cap but cannot interact with eIF4G to initiate translation. There is no mention of EIF4G binding to EIF4E2 in the sentence.                                                                                                                                 \n2  No, the statement is not implied by the sentence. The sentence discusses the relationship between hypoxia, HIF-1α, and iNOS expression in HaCaT cells, while the statement simply states that NOS2 increases the amount of NOS2, without any context or explanation of how it relates to the sentence.                                                                                                                         \n3  The statement \"HDL binds LCAT\" is not explicitly stated in the sentence. The sentence only mentions that apoA-V-enriched HDL is associated with enhanced LCAT activity and increased cholesterol efflux. While it is possible that HDL binds LCAT, this is not directly stated in the sentence.                                                                                                                                \n4  No, the statement is not implied by the paragraph.

The sentence discusses the role of ASF1 in regulating transcription, while the statement discusses the activation of histones by SRSF1, which is not directly related to the topic of the sentence.                                                                                                                                                                          \n7  Yes, the statement \"FOXQ1 binds NRXN3\" is implied by the sentence \"We found that endogenous FoxQ1 protein bound to both of the FoxQ1 binding sites of the NRXN3 promoter.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n8  Yes, the statement \"EGF activates INS\" is implied by the paragraph.
